================
0.13.0 To 0.13.1
================

Migrating a mission model from 0.13.0 to 0.13.1 requires the below two modifications to the model's ``build.gradle``
file.

``Build.gradle`` Edits
-------------------
The runtime environment the model JAR will be deployed to doesn't know what this model depends on.
So the generated JAR must include its dependencies. (Except ``merlin-sdk``, which is marked ``compileTimeApi`` by
``merlin-framework``, so that the runtime system and model JAR can agree on the same interfaces.)

Add the follow block to your mission model's ``build.gradle`` to ensure runtime dependencies are packaged with
the built JAR.

.. code-block:: groovy


  jar {
    from {
      configurations.runtimeClasspath.filter{ it.exists() }.collect{ it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }
    } {
      exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt', 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'
    }
  }

Update Dependencies
-------------------
If your ``build.gradle`` lists ``contrib`` and ``merlin-framework`` libraries as ``compileOnly`` dependencies
then update them to be ``implementation`` dependencies as shown below.

.. code-block:: groovy

  implementation 'gov.nasa.jpl.aerie:contrib:0.13.1'
  implementation 'gov.nasa.jpl.aerie:merlin-framework:0.13.1'
