/**
 * prototype model of the stored battery energy as it discharges/recharges
 *
 * measured in Joules
 *
 * the accumulated battery energy is calculated as the time integral of the provided
 * net power throughput after all sources and sinks have been accounted, starting at
 * some initial stored energy value. while the net power is positive, the battery will
 * gradually recharge, and while the net power is negative, the battery will gradually
 * discharge.
 *
 * the battery charging saturates at the provided upper limit over which extra power
 * input is shunted away by the battery electronics to prevent an overcharging condition
 *
 * this battery model does *not* saturate at a lower limit (such as 0.0J) since this
 * kind of condition can/should be detected by the planning system constraints and
 * brought to user attention. for example, they may be interested in how much the
 * battery was over-drawn.
 * TODO: is this the semantic that is most useful?
 *
 * this battery stored energy is different from the battery state of charge as a
 * percentage, which is calculated from this stored energy value
 *
 * the current implementation is only designed to operate in a forward simulation
