/**
 * An algebra for interval-like operations on some underlying type {@code I}.
 *
 * @param <Alg> A type witnessing the uniqueness of any given implementation.
 *     Another implementation should not be able to use this witness,
 *     and any implementations with the same witness must be equivalent.
 *     This allows containers that sort based on this algebra to constrain operations with other such collections,
 *     e.g. ensuring that `addAll()` is only allowed (or is differently optimized) when the same algebra is used.
 *
 *     If the implementation is unique for a type, and is private, the implementing class may witness itself.
 *     If the implementation is public, use a `private enum Witness {}` nested into the implementing class.
 *     If the implementation may vary in finitely many ways, use as many witnesses as there are ways.
 *     If the implementation may vary more broadly, may God have mercy on your soul --
 *     either use an existential, or use something less fine-grained and be very very careful.
 * @param <I> The type on which this algebra supports interval operations.
