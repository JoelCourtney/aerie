/**
 * A snapshot of a measurable feature of the simulated system at a specific time.
 * <p>
 * A state is any value that the adaptation cares to track via the simulation. Shared
 * states are one of the primary ways in which activity effect models interact with each
 * other.
 * <p>
 * The State class is the most basal interface provided to the activity effect models so
 * that they can sense their simulated environment via basic get() calls to retrieve the
 * then-current value of the state. Additional state interfaces expand on this vocabulary
 * to allow effect models to pose more complex (eg historical) queries as well as various
 * mutations to the state value.
 * <p>
 * Each read/write to a state from an effect model introduces a possible dependency
 * between the state value at that time and the instigating activity instance. These
 * dependencies may be tracked and evaluated to allow efficient recalculation of state
 * values and effect models.
 * <p>
 * All operations occur from the perspective of the current simulation time point at which
 * an instantaneous effect model is executing. Any concurrent modifications by other
 * effect models are not immediately visible;  all such mutations are merged into a
 * consistent new state value before advancing to the next discrete event. The history of
 * different values of the State over time throughout a simulation are recorded and
 * accessed by a distinct StateHistory interface.
 * <p>
 * Instances of State objects should be documented with javadoc blocks that include any
 * relevant tagging used to describe the state semantics, its units, its logical grouping,
 * etc. These attached documentation blocks may be used to integrate with other systems
 * such as flight rules, constraint checkers, state dictionaries, etc.
 *
 * @param <T> the datatype of the measurable value of the state, which must be treated as
 *            immutable

     * The value may be computed dynamically according to relevant interpolation or

     * discrete event plus any modifications made by the current active effect model. Thus
     * subsequent get()s may yield different results even within a discrete event.
     * <p>
     * The observed value does NOT include any concurrent modifications made by other
     * effect models in the same simulation aggregate discrete event, only modifications
     * from prior discrete events. Note that two discrete events may occur within the same
     * temporal moment, eg by one effect model waiting on a condition posted by another.

     * execution and the value of the state at this time. These dependencies may be
