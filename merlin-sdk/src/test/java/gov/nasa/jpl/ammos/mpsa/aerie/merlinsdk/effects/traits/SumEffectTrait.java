/**
 * An effect algebra for combining floating-point numbers by summing.
 *
 * <p>
 * Since addition of floating-point numbers is commutative and conflict-free, we may interpret both concurrent and
 * sequential composition of integers as addition, with 0.0 the empty value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Technically, IEEE-754 floating-point addition does not satisfy associativity, violating the expectations of the
 * {@link EffectTrait} interface. This has the practical effect of potentially introducing non-deterministic error
 * accumulation. If you need deterministic numerical calculations, prefer a fixed-point representation using integers.
 * </p>
