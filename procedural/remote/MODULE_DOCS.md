# Module Remote

This library provides tools for accessing plans and simulation results from remote execution environments.
This is intended to allow goal and constraint authors to run their code outside Aerie, and these implementations
do not need to be packaged in the goal and constraint jars.

# Package gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.procedural.remote
Remote utilities for running goals and constraints outside of Aerie.
