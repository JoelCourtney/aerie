   *
   * operates according to the solver's controlling configuration to determine
   * a new solution, which may range from an iterative improvement on a prior
   * solution up to a contrasting high level alternative for consideration
   *
   * in general, the solution trajectory is not guaranteed to be identical
   * across different executions on the same problem, though some specific
   * algorithms may optionally support deterministic solution trajectories
   *
   * in general, the solver method is not re-entrant safe, though some
   * specific algorithms may optionally support parallel solution requests
   *
   * in general, the solver requires that any previously specified input
   * planning problem descriptor and solver configuration remain unchanged
   * between successive calls, though some algorithms may optionally support
   * changing problem specification
   *
   * the algorithm may return no solution in the event the solver has
   * expended all of its solutions (eg by reaching a requested quality
   * threshold, proving an optimum solution, exhausting the configured
   * alternative search space, etc). in general, the solver will return no
   * solution for all requests thereafter, but some algorithms may optionally
   * support further solutions (eg on some input/configuration modification)
